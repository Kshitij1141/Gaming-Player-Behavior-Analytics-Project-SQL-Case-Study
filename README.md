## Project Overview

This project analyzes player behavior using a simulated gaming database. It covers a comprehensive range of SQL concepts to extract meaningful insights from player activities, game sessions, achievements, and in-game purchases. The goal is to showcase advanced SQL skills including data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and date arithmetic.

## Database Schema

### Tables Overview

- **Players**: Contains player details such as player_id, username, registration_date, country, and last login information.
- **GameSessions**: Logs individual gameplay sessions with start and end timestamps, duration, and game mode.
- **Achievements**: Defines all available in-game achievements with their descriptions and points awarded.
- **PlayerAchievements**: Tracks which players unlocked which achievements and the date unlocked.
- **InGamePurchases**: Includes records of all transactions players made within the gameâ€”item names, types, purchase timestamps, and prices.

### Example Table Definitions (DDL)

CREATE TABLE Players (
  player_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  registration_date DATE NOT NULL,
  country VARCHAR(255),
  last_login_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE GameSessions (
  session_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id INT NOT NULL,
  start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  end_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  duration_minutes INT,
  game_mode VARCHAR(255),
  FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES Players(player_id)
);

Additional tables for Achievements, PlayerAchievements, InGamePurchases omitted for brevity

## Query Sets & Solutions

### Query Set 1: Basic Data Retrieval and Filtering
- Retrieve all players or filter by country.
- Find players with recent logins.
- List expensive in-game purchases.
- Filter sessions by game mode.

### Query Set 2: Aggregations and Grouping
- Count total players.
- Calculate average session durations.
- Total revenue from purchases.
- Purchases and sessions grouped by categories and types.

### Query Set 3: Joins and Subqueries
- Combine player data with purchases and achievements.
- Find players who unlocked specific achievements.
- Calculate total playtime per player.
- Identify top spenders and players without purchases.

### Query Set 4: Advanced SQL Concepts
- Use window functions (e.g., DENSE_RANK for achievement ranks).
- Calculate longest login streaks using CTEs.
- Compute retention rates for player cohorts.
- Complex date arithmetic for behavior analysis.

*Detailed SQL queries are included in the project files.*

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- SELECT, WHERE, and filtering techniques.
- Aggregations using COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY.
- INNER and LEFT JOIN operations.
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- Window functions like DENSE_RANK and ROW_NUMBER.
- Date functions and arithmetic (YEAR, MONTH, INTERVAL).
- Conditional CASE statements for flexible computations.
- Ranking and sequence calculations.

## Use Cases and Business Value

This project is an example of how game developers and analysts can leverage SQL to understand player engagement patterns, monitor revenue streams, optimize game design, and improve marketing strategies. Analyses such as identifying top spenders, measuring session durations, and calculating retention rates empower data-driven decision making to enhance player experience and maximize monetization.

---

## How to Run the Queries

1. Set up the database schema using provided DDL scripts.
2. Populate tables with sample or real player and game session data.
3. Run SQL queries sequentially in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
4. Modify queries as needed to fit your dataset or specific analysis goals.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate real-time player event tracking.
- Extend analysis to cover player segmentation and churn prediction.
- Integrate visualization tools for interactive dashboards.
- Use machine learning models on top of SQL analyses for predictive insights.
